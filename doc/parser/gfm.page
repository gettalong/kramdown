# GFM Parser

## Introduction

Parse ["Github Flavored Markdown"](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown). This is a format of Markdown that is used on Github.com for most places where textual input is required, such as issues and comments. Some of the extensions, notably the "backtick fenced code blocks" are also used on other sites, for example StackOverflow.

## Conformance

At the moment this parser is identical to the Kramdown parser, except that it adds support for fenced code blocks using three or more backticks to delimit the block.
