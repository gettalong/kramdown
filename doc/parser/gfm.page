# GFM Parser

## Introduction

This parser can parse ["Github Flavored
Markdown"](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown). This is a format of Markdown
that is used on Github.com for most places where textual input is required, such as issues and
comments. Some of the extensions, notably the "backtick fenced code blocks" are also used on other
sites, for example StackOverflow.

## Conformance

At the moment this parser is based on the [kramdown parser](kramdown.html), with the following
changes:

* Support for fenced code blocks using three or more backticks has been added.
* Hard line breaks in paragraphs are enforced by default (see option 'hard_wrap').
* ATX headers need a whitespace character after the hash signs.
* Strikethroughs can be created using two tildes surrounding a piece of text

## Options

The GFM parser supports the following options:

{options: {items: [hard_wrap]}}
