# GFM Parser

## Introduction

This parser can parse ["Github Flavored
Markdown"](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown). This is a format of Markdown
that is used on Github.com for most places where textual input is required, such as issues and
comments. Some of the extensions, notably the "backtick fenced code blocks" are also used on other
sites, for example StackOverflow.

## Conformance

At the moment this parser is identical to the kramdown parser, except that it adds support for
fenced code blocks using three or more backticks and enforces hard line breaks in paragraphs.

## Options

The GFM parser supports the following options:

{options: {items: [hard_wrap]}}
