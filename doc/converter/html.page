# HTML Converter

This converter converts a kramdown element tree into a HTML fragment and supports all available
element types. Below is a list of additional features of the HTML converter as well as some
additional information.


## Automatic Generation of Header IDs    {#auto-ids}

kramdown supports the automatic generation of header IDs if the option `auto_ids` is set to `true`
(which is the default). This is done by converting the untransformed, i.e. plain, header text via the
following steps:

* All characters except letters, numbers, spaces and dashes are removed.
* All characters from the start of the line until the first letter are removed.
* Everything except letters and numbers is converted to dashes.
* Everything is lowercased.
* If nothing is left, the identifier `section` is used.
* If a such created identifier already exists, a dash and a sequential number is added (first `-1`,
  then `-2` and so on).

Following are some examples of header texts and their respective generated IDs:

    # This is a header
    auto_id: this-is-a-header

    ## 12. Another one 1 here
    auto_id: another-one-1-here

    ### Do ^& it now
    auto_id: do--it-now

    Hallo
    =====
    auto_id: hallo

    Not now
    -------
    auto_id: not-now

    # Hallo
    auto_id: hallo-1

    # 123456789
    auto_id: section

> The automatic creation of header IDs is not part of standard Markdown. The rules on how header
> text is converted to an identifier are based on the rules specified by [Pandoc].
{: .markdown-difference}

Such generated IDs are only used if no ID has been set manually before.


## Code Blocks

A code block is wrapped in both `<pre>` and  `<code>` tags.

### Showing Whitespace in a Code Block

It is sometimes useful to visualize whitespace within a code block. This can be achieved by adding
the class `show-whitespaces` to a code block (using a [block
IAL](../syntax.html#block-inline-attribute-lists)).

Here is an example where the whitespaces are shown:

    	  leading tab	and space
    trailing   tab and space    	
{: .show-whitespaces}

When showing whitespace in a code block, all spaces are replaced with the entity `&sdot;` and
additionally spaces and tabs in the code block are marked up using HTML `span` tags and the
following CSS classes:

* `ws-space-l`, `ws-tab-l`: leading spaces/tabs
* `ws-space-r`, `ws-tab-r`: trailing spaces/tabs
* `ws-space`, `ws-tab`: spaces/tabs in between


### Automatic Syntax Highlighting   {#syntax-highlighting}

kramdown supports syntax highlighting of code blocks. Just add the key `lang` to a code block (using
a [block IAL](../syntax.html#block-inline-attribute-lists)) and it will be highlighted using the
specified language.

Syntax highlighting for text in a code blocks is done using the
[CodeRay](http://coderay.rubychan.de) library which can be installed, for example, via Rubygems.
Have a look at the CodeRay homepage to see all supported languages.

Here is an example on how Ruby code is highlighted:

    require 'kramdown'

    Kramdown::Document.new('* something').to_html
    puts 1 + 1
{: lang='ruby'}


## Math Support

If you want math formulas correctly displayed, you have to include the [jsMath] javascript library
in the HTML file (see the [jsMath homepage][jsMath] for details). Note that kramdown does *not* ship
with the jsMath library and that therefore the `default` template does *not* include a link to it!

Why jsMath? Because I think that it is simply the best way to display LaTeX math formulas on the
Web.


## Emphasis

kramdown uses the HTML element `em` to style light and the element `strong` to style strong
emphasized text parts.


## Automatic "Table of Contents" Generation    {#toc}

kramdown supports the automatic generation of the table of contents of all headers that have an ID
set. Just assign the reference name "toc" to an ordered or unordered list by using an IAL and the
list will be replaced with the actual table of contents, rendered as nested unordered lists if "toc"
was applied to an unordered list or else as nested ordered lists. All attributes applied to the
original list will also be applied to the generated TOC list and it will get an ID of `markdown-toc`
if no ID was set.

Here is an example:

    * Will be replaced with the ToC
    {:toc}

    # H1 header

    ## H2 header


## Options

The HTML converter supports the following options:

{options: {items: [:auto_ids, :template, :footnote_nr, :toc_depth, :coderay_wrap, :coderay_line_numbers, :coderay_line_number_start, :coderay_tab_width, :coderay_bold_every, :coderay_css]}}


{include_file: doc/links.markdown}
