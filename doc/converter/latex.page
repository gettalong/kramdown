# LaTeX Converter

This converter converts a kramdown element tree into LaTeX. It supports all available element types
except the HTML specific ones. The LaTeX document can, for example, further be converted to a PDF
file to produce a high quality, printable version.

Since the LaTeX converter outputs just the converted element tree and not a whole LaTeX document by
default, one should always use the `template` option (see below) to include the necessary
"framework". There are also some [other options](#options) that can be used to customize the
generated LaTeX output.


## Needed Packages

Some packages are always required (when using the provided `document` template):

* `inputenc` and `fontenc`
* `listings` (see [Code Blocks](#code-blocks))
* `ucs` (when using Ruby 1.8)
* `hyperref`

The following LaTeX packages are needed to support certain features and are only included if such a
feature is actually used:

* `amssymb`, `amsmath`, `amsthm`, `amsfonts` (for math support)
* `graphicx` (for image support)
* `wasysym`, `amssymb`, `mathabx`, `textcomp`, `mathcomp`, `eurosym` (for special entity character
  support)
* `fancyvrb` (see [Footnotes](#footnotes))


## Hyper Targets and Links

Headers which have an ID set (either manually or, if the option `auto_ids` is set to `true`, an
automatically generated one -- for details on how the ID is generated see the [corresponding
section](html.html#auto-ids) of the HTML converter documentation) are available as hyper targets
within the LaTeX document. And in-document links (those starting with `#`) are transformed into an
hyper link. This means that when a PDF is generated from the LaTeX document, in-document links will
work correctly.


## Code Blocks

The LaTeX converter supports the visualisation of whitespace and syntax highlighting as specified in
the [HTML converter documentation](html.html#code-blocks). Syntax highlighting and visualizing
whitespace in a code block is done using the `listings` package. So all languages supported by the
`listings` package can be highlighted.


## Quotation Marks

The default quotation marks that are used are the English ones:

* left single quote (`lsquo`): `` ` ``
* right single quote (`rsquo`): `'`
* left double quote (`ldquo`): ``` `` ```
* right double quote (`rdquo`): `''`

You can change the used quotation marks by writing some code, like in the following example:

    require 'kramdown'

    my_quotes = {:lsquo => '\\glq{}', :rsquo => '\\grq{}', :ldquo => '"`', :rdquo => '"\''}
    Kramdown::Converter::Latex::SMART_QUOTE_SYMS.merge!(my_quotes)

    puts Kramdown::Document.new(ARGF.read).to_latex
{: lang="ruby"}


## Emphasis

The latex command `emph` is used for light and the command `textbf` for strong emphasis.


## Footnotes

The `fancyvrb` package is used to support code blocks (i.e. verbatim environments) inside footnotes.


## Automatic "Table of Contents" Generation

If you add a "toc" reference to a list as described on the [HTML converter page](html.html#toc), the
list is replaced by the table of contents using the `\tableofcontents` command.


## Standalone Images

The LaTeX converter handles images that are the only child of a paragraph specially. Such images are
not shown inline but rather in a `figure` environment, using the alternative text as caption.


## Element Attributes

Since the element attributes cannot be used directly by the LaTeX converter in most cases, the
converter outputs them as LaTeX comment when possible so that a post-processor can make use of them.
The attributes are output as key value pairs (like XHTML attributes) and sorted by the key.

Here is an example input and output:

    > This is a quote.
    {: #my-id .cls}

will be converted by the LaTeX converter to:

    \begin{quote}   % class="cls" id="my-id"
    This is a quote.
    \end{quote}

The attributes are output for the following elements: blockquotes; ordered, unordered and definition
lists; code blocks that use the `listings` environment; tables; and math blocks.


## Options

The LaTeX converter supports the following options:

{options: {items: [:auto_ids, :toc_levels, :latex_headers, :template]}}


{include_file: doc/links.markdown}
