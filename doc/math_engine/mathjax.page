## Math Engine MathJax

[MathJax] is a javascript library that uses the TeX algorithms and fonts to display math formulas on
HTML pages. It allows for very fine-grained configuration, is widely used and works on all modern
browsers.

This engine marks up math formulas with HTML `<script type="math/tex">` tags that MathJax
understands. The only other thing to do is to include the MathJax library itself on the HTML page.

Note that kramdown does *not* ship with the MathJax library and that therefore the "default"
template does *not* include a link to it! The
[MathJax documentation](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html) describes how to add a link
to MathJax to your page.

## Using KaTeX instead of MathJax

To use [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/) instead of MathJax, activate the MathJax engine in
kramdown, include the KaTeX Javascript files in the HTML file and put the following script at the
end of the HTML file:

~~~ html
<script>
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
        document.querySelectorAll("script[type='math/tex']").forEach(e => {
            let tex = e.innerText;
            let html = katex.renderToString(tex, {displayMode: false});
            e.outerHTML = html;
        });
        document.querySelectorAll("script[type='math/tex; mode=display']").forEach(e => {
            let tex = e.innerText;
            let html = katex.renderToString(tex, {displayMode: true});
            e.outerHTML = html;
        });
    });
</script>
~~~

Note that including the KaTeX Javascript files and the above script is normally done using a
template file (see the [template option](../options.html).

See [this comment](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/292#issuecomment-257770946) for more
details.


## Options

The MathJax engine supports the following keys of the option
['math_engine_opts'](../options.html#option-math-engine-opts):

preview
: Specifies whether a preview should be shown. It defaults to `false` but if set to `true`, a
  preview with the LaTeX code itself is shown. If it is set to any value other than `false` or
  `true`, that value is shown as the preview.

preview_as_code
: When `true`, wraps the LaTeX code in `code` / `pre > code` tags instead of `span` / `div` tags,
  mirroring the structure of inline code / code blocks. This ensures the content is styled like
  regular code and improves legibility in RSS readers, text browsers, etc.

  To prevent styling issues after MathJax has loaded, consider adding
  `.MathJax_Preview:empty { display:none }` to your CSS.

  Defaults to `false` and only works if `preview` is `true`.
