## Math Engine MathJax

[MathJax] is a javascript library that uses the TeX algorithms and fonts to display math formulas on
HTML pages. It allows for very fine-grained configuration, is widely used and works on all modern
browsers.

This engine marks up math formulas with HTML `<script type="math/tex">` tags that MathJax
understands. The only other thing to do is to include the MathJax library itself on the HTML page.

Note that kramdown does *not* ship with the MathJax library and that therefore the "default"
template does *not* include a link to it! The
[MathJax documentation](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html) describes how to add a link
to MathJax to your page.


The MathJax engine supports the following keys of the option
['math_engine_opts'](../options.html#option-math-engine-opts):

preview
: Specifies whether a preview should be shown. It defaults to `false` but if set to `true`, a
  preview with the LaTeX code itself is shown. If it is set to any value other than `false` or
  `true`, that value is shown as the preview.

preview_as_code
: When `true`, wraps the LaTeX code in `code` / `pre > code` tags instead of `span` / `div` tags,
  mirroring the structure of inline code / code blocks.
  This ensures the content is styled like regular code and improves legibility in RSS readers,
  text browsers, etc.
  To prevent styling issues after MathJax has loaded, consider adding
  `.MathJax_Preview:empty{display:none}` to your CSS.
  Defaults to `false` and expects `preview` to be `true`.
