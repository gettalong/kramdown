## Math Engine MathJax

[MathJax] is a javascript library that uses the TeX algorithms and fonts to display math formulas on
HTML pages. It allows for very fine-grained configuration, is widely used and works on all modern
browsers.

This engine marks up math formulas with HTML `<script type="math/tex">` tags that MathJax
understands. The only other thing to do is to include the MathJax library itself on the HTML page.

Note that kramdown does *not* ship with the MathJax library and that therefore the "default"
template does *not* include a link to it!
