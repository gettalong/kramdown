## Math Engine MathJax

[MathJax] is a javascript library that uses the TeX algorithms and fonts to display math formulas on
HTML pages. It allows for very fine-grained configuration, is widely used and works on all modern
browsers.

This engine marks up math formulas with HTML `<script type="math/tex">` tags that MathJax
understands. The only other thing to do is to include the MathJax library itself on the HTML page.

Note that kramdown does *not* ship with the MathJax library and that therefore the "default"
template does *not* include a link to it! The
[MathJax documentation](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html) describes how to add a link
to MathJax to your page.


The MathJax engine supports the following keys of the option
['math_engine_opts'](../options.html#option-math-engine-opts):

preview
: Specifies whether a preview should be shown. It defaults to `false` but if set to `true`, a
  preview with the LaTeX code itself is shown. If it is set to any value other than `false` or
  `true`, that value is shown as the preview.
