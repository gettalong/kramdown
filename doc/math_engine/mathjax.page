## Math Engine MathJax

[MathJax] is a javascript library that uses the TeX algorithms and fonts to display math formulas on
HTML pages. It allows for very fine-grained configuration, is widely used and works on all modern
browsers.

This engine marks up math formulas with the standard MathJax syntax of `\(...\)` for inline math and
`\[...\]` for block math (works for both version 2.x and 3.x of MathJax). The only other thing to do
is to include the MathJax library itself on the HTML page.

Note that kramdown does *not* ship with the MathJax library and that therefore the "default"
template does *not* include a link to it! The
[MathJax documentation](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html) describes how to add a link
to MathJax to your page.
