## Math Engine Mathjax-Node

[Mathjax-Node](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-node) converts TeX math formulas into
MathML and can be used together with the [HTML converter](../converter/html.html).

To use Mathjax-Node, set the option ['math_engine'](../options.html#option-math-engine) to
'mathjaxnode' and make sure that Mathjax-Node is available. The Mathjax-Node library can be
installed, e.g., via npm by running `npm install -g MathJax-node`.

The Mathjax-Node engine supports the following keys of the option
['math_engine_opts'](../options.html#option-math-engine-opts):

semantics
: Specifies whether TeX code should be added in a `<semantics>` tag. It defaults to `false` but if
  set to `true`, a `<semantics>` tag with the LaTeX code itself is added.

texhints
: Specifies whether TeX-specific classes should be added. It defaults to `true` but if set to
  `false`, the TeX-specific classes, like `MJX-TeXAtom-ORD`, will not be added. These classes
  provide styling hints to the MathJax browser library.

The MathJax-node library is released under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
