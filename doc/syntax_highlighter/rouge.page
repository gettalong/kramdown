## Syntax Highlighting With Rouge

[Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge) (MIT licensed) is a fast syntax highlighter that is
compatible with stylesheets designed for Pygments.

To use Rouge, set the option ['syntax_highlighter'](../options.html#option-syntax-highlighter) to
'rouge' and make sure that Rouge is available. The Rouge library can be installed, e.g., via
Rubygems by running `gem install rouge`.

The Rouge syntax highlighter supports the following keys of the option
['syntax_highlighter_opts'](../options.html#option-syntax-highlighter-opts):

default_lang
: The default language that should be used when no language is set.

formatter
: A custom Rouge formatter class that should be used instead of `Rouge::Formatters::HTML`.

  Note that setting this key only makes sense using Ruby code because the value needs to be a class
  object!
